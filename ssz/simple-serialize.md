## Constants

| Name | Value | Description |
|-|-|-|
| `BYTES_PER_CHUNK` | `32` | Number of bytes per chunk. |
| `BYTES_PER_LENGTH_OFFSET` | `4` | Number of bytes per serialized length offset. |
| `BITS_PER_BYTE` | `8` | Number of bits per byte. |

## Typing
### Basic types

* `uintN`: `N`-bit unsigned integer (where `N in [8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256]`)
* `byte`: 8-bit opaque data container, equivalent in serialization and hashing to `uint8`
* `boolean`: `True` or `False`

### Composite types

* **container**: ordered heterogeneous collection of values
    * python dataclass notation with key-type pairs, e.g.
    ```python
    class ContainerExample(Container):
        foo: uint64
        bar: boolean
    ```
* **stablecontainer**: ordered heterogeneous collection of optional values, with `N` indicating the potential maximum number of fields to which it can ever grow in the future
    * notation `StableContainer[N]`, with `Optional[T]` refering to Python's `typing.Optional`, e.g.
    ```python
    class Shape(StableContainer[4]):
        side: Optional[uint16]
        color: Optional[uint8]
        radius: Optional[uint16]
    ```
* **profile**: ordered heterogeneous collection of a subset of values of a base `StableContainer` type `B`
    * notation `Profile[B]`, e.g.
    ```python
    class Square(Profile[Shape]):
        side: uint16
        color: Optional[uint8]
    ```
* **vector**: ordered fixed-length homogeneous collection, with `N` values
    * notation `Vector[type, N]`, e.g. `Vector[uint64, N]`
* **list**: ordered variable-length homogeneous collection, limited to `N` values
    * notation `List[type, N]`, e.g. `List[uint64, N]`
* **bitvector**: ordered fixed-length collection of `boolean` values, with `N` bits
    * notation `Bitvector[N]`
* **bitlist**: ordered variable-length collection of `boolean` values, limited to `N` bits
    * notation `Bitlist[N]`
* **union**: union type containing one of the given subtypes
    * notation `Union[type_0, type_1, ...]`, e.g. `union[None, uint64, uint32]`

*Note*: Both `Vector[boolean, N]` and `Bitvector[N]` are valid, yet distinct due to their different serialization requirements. Similarly, both `List[boolean, N]` and `Bitlist[N]` are valid, yet distinct. Generally `Bitvector[N]`/`Bitlist[N]` are preferred because of their serialization efficiencies.

### Variable-size and fixed-size

We recursively define "variable-size" types to be lists, unions, `Bitlist`, `StableContainer`, `Profile` that contain optional fields, and all types that contain a variable-size type. All other types are said to be "fixed-size".

### Byte

Although the SSZ serialization of `byte` is equivalent to that of `uint8`, the former is used for opaque data while the latter is intended as a number.

### Aliases

For convenience we alias:

* `bit` to `boolean`
* `BytesN` and `ByteVector[N]` to `Vector[byte, N]` (this is *not* a basic type)
* `ByteList[N]` to `List[byte, N]`

Aliases are semantically equivalent to their underlying type and therefore share canonical representations both in SSZ and in related formats.

### Default values
Assuming a helper function `default(type)` which returns the default value for `type`, we can recursively define the default value for all types.

| Type | Default Value |
| ---- | ------------- |
| `uintN` | `0` |
| `boolean` | `False` |
| `Container` | `[default(type) for type in container]` |
| `StableContainer[N]` | `[None * N]` |
| `Profile[B]` | `[default(type) for type in profile]` |
| `Vector[type, N]` | `[default(type)] * N` |
| `Bitvector[N]` | `[False] * N` |
| `List[type, N]` | `[]` |
| `Bitlist[N]` | `[]` |
| `Union[type_0, type_1, ...]` | `default(type_0)` |

#### `is_zero`

An SSZ object is called zeroed (and thus, `is_zero(object)` returns true) if it is equal to the default value for that type.

### Illegal types

- Empty vector types (`Vector[type, 0]`, `Bitvector[0]`) are illegal.
- Containers with no fields are illegal.
- StableContainers with `N <= 0` are illegal.
- StableContainers with non-optional fields are illegal.
- The `None` type option in a `Union` type is only legal as the first option (i.e. with index zero).

### `Profile[B]` constraints

- Fields in `Profile[B]` correspond to fields with the same field name in `B`.
- Fields in `Profile[B]` follow the same order as in `B`.
- Fields in the base `StableContainer` type `B` are all `Optional`.
  - Fields MAY be disallowed in `Profile[B]` by omitting them.
  - Fields MAY be kept optional in `Profile[B]` by retaining them as `Optional`.
  - Fields MAY be required in `Profile[B]` by unwrapping them from `Optional`.
- All field types in `Profile[B]` MUST be compatible with the corresponding field types in `B`.
  - Field types are compatible with themselves.
  - `byte` is compatible with `uint8` and vice versa.
  - `Bitlist[N]` / `Bitvector[N]` field types are compatible if they share the same capacity `N`.
  - `List[T, N]` / `Vector[T, N]` field types are compatible if `T` is compatible and if they also share the same capacity `N`.
  - `Container` / `StableContainer[N]` field types are compatible if all inner field types are compatible, if they also share the same field names in the same order, and for `StableContainer[N]` if they also share the same capacity `N`.
  - `Profile[X]` field types are compatible with `StableContainer` types compatible with `X`, and are compatible with `Profile[Y]` where `Y` is compatible with `X` if also all inner field types are compatible. Differences solely in optionality do not affect merkleization compatibility.

## Serialization

We recursively define the `serialize` function which consumes an object `value` (of the type specified) and returns a bytestring of type `bytes`.

*Note*: In the function definitions below (`serialize`, `hash_tree_root`, `is_variable_size`, etc.) objects implicitly carry their type.

### `uintN`

```python
assert N in [8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256]
return value.to_bytes(N // BITS_PER_BYTE, "little")
```

### `boolean`

```python
assert value in (True, False)
return b"\x01" if value is True else b"\x00"
```

### `Bitvector[N]`

```python
array = [0] * ((N + 7) // 8)
for i in range(N):
    array[i // 8] |= value[i] << (i % 8)
return bytes(array)
```

### `Bitlist[N]`

Note that from the offset coding, the length (in bytes) of the bitlist is known. An additional `1` bit is added to the end, at index `e` where `e` is the length of the bitlist (not the limit), so that the length in bits will also be known.

```python
array = [0] * ((len(value) // 8) + 1)
for i in range(len(value)):
    array[i // 8] |= value[i] << (i % 8)
array[len(value) // 8] |= 1 << (len(value) % 8)
return bytes(array)
```

### Vectors, containers, lists

```python
# Recursively serialize
fixed_parts = [serialize(element) if not is_variable_size(element) else None for element in value]
variable_parts = [serialize(element) if is_variable_size(element) else b"" for element in value]

# Compute and check lengths
fixed_lengths = [len(part) if part != None else BYTES_PER_LENGTH_OFFSET for part in fixed_parts]
variable_lengths = [len(part) for part in variable_parts]
assert sum(fixed_lengths + variable_lengths) < 2**(BYTES_PER_LENGTH_OFFSET * BITS_PER_BYTE)

# Interleave offsets of variable-size parts with fixed-size parts
variable_offsets = [serialize(uint32(sum(fixed_lengths + variable_lengths[:i]))) for i in range(len(value))]
fixed_parts = [part if part != None else variable_offsets[i] for i, part in enumerate(fixed_parts)]

# Return the concatenation of the fixed-size parts (offsets interleaved) with the variable-size parts
return b"".join(fixed_parts + variable_parts)
```

### `StableContainer[N]`

Serialization of `StableContainer[N]` is defined similarly to `Container`. Notable changes are:

- A `Bitvector[N]` is constructed, indicating active fields within the `StableContainer[N]`. For fields with a present value (not `None`), a `True` bit is included. For fields with a `None` value, a `False` bit is included. The `Bitvector[N]` is padded with `False` bits up through length `N`
- Only active fields are serialized, i.e., fields with a corresponding `True` bit in the `Bitvector[N]`
- The serialization of the `Bitvector[N]` is prepended to the serialized active fields
- If variable-length fields are serialized, their offsets are relative to the start of serialized active fields, after the `Bitvector[N]`

```python
def is_active_field(element):
    return not is_optional(element) or element is not None

# Determine active fields
active_fields = Bitvector[N](([is_active_field(element) for element in value] + [False] * N)[:N])
active_values = [element for element in value if is_active_field(element)]

# Recursively serialize
fixed_parts = [serialize(element) if not is_variable_size(element) else None for element in active_values]
variable_parts = [serialize(element) if is_variable_size(element) else b"" for element in active_values]

# Compute and check lengths
fixed_lengths = [len(part) if part != None else BYTES_PER_LENGTH_OFFSET for part in fixed_parts]
variable_lengths = [len(part) for part in variable_parts]
assert sum(fixed_lengths + variable_lengths) < 2**(BYTES_PER_LENGTH_OFFSET * BITS_PER_BYTE)

# Interleave offsets of variable-size parts with fixed-size parts
variable_offsets = [serialize(uint32(sum(fixed_lengths + variable_lengths[:i]))) for i in range(len(active_values))]
fixed_parts = [part if part != None else variable_offsets[i] for i, part in enumerate(fixed_parts)]

# Return the concatenation of the active fields `Bitvector` with the active
# fixed-size parts (offsets interleaved) and the active variable-size parts
return serialize(active_fields) + b"".join(fixed_parts + variable_parts)
```

### `Profile[B]`

Serialization of `Profile[B]` is similar to the one of its base `StableContainer[N]`, except that the leading `Bitvector` is replaced by a sparse representation that only includes information about fields that are optional in `Profile[B]`. Bits for required fields of `Profile[B]` as well as the zero-padding to capacity `N` are not included. If there are no optional fields in `Profile[B]`, the `Bitvector` is omitted.

### Union

A `value` as `Union[T...]` type has properties `value.value` with the contained value, and `value.selector` which indexes the selected `Union` type option `T`.

A `Union`:
- May have multiple selectors with the same type.
- Should not use selectors above 127 (i.e. highest bit is set), these are reserved for backwards compatible extensions.
- Must have at least 1 type option.
- May have `None` as first type option, i.e. `selector == 0`
- Must have at least 2 type options if the first is `None`
- Is always considered a variable-length type, even if all type options have an equal fixed-length.

```python
if value.value is None:
    assert value.selector == 0
    return b"\x00"
else:
    serialized_bytes = serialize(value.value)
    serialized_selector_index = value.selector.to_bytes(1, "little")
    return serialized_selector_index + serialized_bytes
```

## Deserialization

Because serialization is an injective function (i.e. two distinct objects of the same type will serialize to different values) any bytestring has at most one object it could deserialize to.

Deserialization can be implemented using a recursive algorithm. The deserialization of basic objects is easy, and from there we can find a simple recursive algorithm for all fixed-size objects. For variable-size objects we have to do one of the following depending on what kind of object it is:

* Vector/list of a variable-size object: The serialized data will start with offsets of all the serialized objects (`BYTES_PER_LENGTH_OFFSET` bytes each).
  * Using the first offset, we can compute the length of the list (divide by `BYTES_PER_LENGTH_OFFSET`), as it gives us the total number of bytes in the offset data.
  * The size of each object in the vector/list can be inferred from the difference of two offsets. To get the size of the last object, the total number of bytes has to be known (it is not generally possible to deserialize an SSZ object of unknown length)
* Containers follow the same principles as vectors, with the difference that there may be fixed-size objects in a container as well. This means the `fixed_parts` data will contain offsets as well as fixed-size objects.
* `StableContainer[N]`: The serialized data will start with a `Bitvector[N]`. That value MUST be validated: All extra bits in the `Bitvector[N]` that exceed the number of fields MUST be `False`. The rest of the data is deserialized same as a regular SSZ `Container`, consulting the `Bitvector[N]` to determine which fields are present in the data. Absent fields are skipped during deserialization and assigned `None` values.
* `Profile[B]`: If there are optional fields in `Profile[B]`, the serialized data will start with a `Bitvector[O]` with `O` set to the total number of optional fields. The rest of the data is deserialized same as a regular SSZ `Container`, consulting the `Bitvector[O]` to determine which fields are present in the data. Absent fields are skipped during deserialization and assigned `None` values.
* In the case of bitlists, the length in bits cannot be uniquely inferred from the number of bytes in the object. Because of this, they have a bit at the end that is always set. This bit has to be used to infer the size of the bitlist in bits.
* In the case of unions, the first byte of the deserialization scope is deserialized as type selector, the remainder of the scope is deserialized as the selected type.

Note that deserialization requires hardening against invalid inputs. A non-exhaustive list:

- Offsets: out of order, out of range, mismatching minimum element size.
- Scope: Extra unused bytes, not aligned with element size.
- More elements than a list limit allows. Part of enforcing consensus.
- An out-of-bounds selected index in an `Union`

Efficient algorithms for computing this object can be found in [the implementations](#implementations).

## Merkleization

We first define helper functions:

* `size_of(B)`, where `B` is a basic type: the length, in bytes, of the serialized form of the basic type.
* `chunk_count(type)`: calculate the amount of leafs for merkleization of the type.
   * all basic types: `1`
   * `Bitlist[N]` and `Bitvector[N]`: `(N + 255) // 256` (dividing by chunk size, rounding up)
   * `List[B, N]` and `Vector[B, N]`, where `B` is a basic type: `(N * size_of(B) + 31) // 32` (dividing by chunk size, rounding up)
   * `List[C, N]` and `Vector[C, N]`, where `C` is a composite type: `N`
   * containers: `len(fields)`
   * `StableContainer[N]`: always `N`, regardless of the actual number of fields in the type definition
* `pack(values)`: Given ordered objects of the same basic type:
   1. Serialize `values` into bytes.
   2. If not aligned to a multiple of `BYTES_PER_CHUNK` bytes, right-pad with zeroes to the next multiple.
   3. Partition the bytes into `BYTES_PER_CHUNK`-byte chunks.
   4. Return the chunks.
* `pack_bits(bits)`: Given the bits of bitlist or bitvector, get `bitfield_bytes` by packing them in bytes and aligning to the start. The length-delimiting bit for bitlists is excluded. Then return `pack(bitfield_bytes)`.
* `next_pow_of_two(i)`: get the next power of 2 of `i`, if not already a power of 2, with 0 mapping to 1. Examples: `0->1, 1->1, 2->2, 3->4, 4->4, 6->8, 9->16`
* `merkleize(chunks, limit=None)`: Given ordered `BYTES_PER_CHUNK`-byte chunks, merkleize the chunks, and return the root:
    * The merkleization depends on the effective input, which must be padded/limited:
        - if no limit: pad the `chunks` with zeroed chunks to `next_pow_of_two(len(chunks))` (virtually for memory efficiency).
        - if `limit >= len(chunks)`, pad the `chunks` with zeroed chunks to `next_pow_of_two(limit)` (virtually for memory efficiency).
        - if `limit < len(chunks)`: do not merkleize, input exceeds limit. Raise an error instead.
    * Then, merkleize the chunks (empty input is padded to 1 zero chunk):
        - If `1` chunk: the root is the chunk itself.
        - If `> 1` chunks: merkleize as binary tree.
* `mix_in_length`: Given a Merkle root `root` and a length `length` (`"uint256"` little-endian serialization) return `hash(root + length)`.
* `mix_in_aux`: Given a Merkle root `root` and an auxiliary SSZ object root `aux` return `hash(root + aux)`.
* `mix_in_selector`: Given a Merkle root `root` and a type selector `selector` (`"uint256"` little-endian serialization) return `hash(root + selector)`.

We now define Merkleization `hash_tree_root(value)` of an object `value` recursively:

* `merkleize(pack(value))` if `value` is a basic object or a vector of basic objects.
* `merkleize(pack_bits(value), limit=chunk_count(type))` if `value` is a bitvector.
* `mix_in_length(merkleize(pack(value), limit=chunk_count(type)), len(value))` if `value` is a list of basic objects.
* `mix_in_length(merkleize(pack_bits(value), limit=chunk_count(type)), len(value))` if `value` is a bitlist.
* `merkleize([hash_tree_root(element) for element in value])` if `value` is a vector of composite objects or a container.
* `mix_in_length(merkleize([hash_tree_root(element) for element in value], limit=chunk_count(type)), len(value))` if `value` is a list of composite objects.
* `mix_in_aux(merkleize(([hash_tree_root(element) if is_active_field(element) else Bytes32() for element in value.data] + [Bytes32()] * N)[:N]), hash_tree_root(value.active_fields))` if `value` is a `StableContainer[N]`.
* Merkleization of `Profile[B]` follows the merkleization of base type `B`.
* `mix_in_selector(hash_tree_root(value.value), value.selector)` if `value` is of union type, and `value.value` is not `None`
* `mix_in_selector(Bytes32(), 0)` if `value` is of union type, and `value.value` is `None`

## Summaries and expansions

Let `A` be an object derived from another object `B` by replacing some of the (possibly nested) values of `B` by their `hash_tree_root`. We say `A` is a "summary" of `B`, and that `B` is an "expansion" of `A`. Notice `hash_tree_root(A) == hash_tree_root(B)`.

We similarly define "summary types" and "expansion types". For example, [`BeaconBlock`](../specs/phase0/beacon-chain.md#beaconblock) is an expansion type of [`BeaconBlockHeader`](../specs/phase0/beacon-chain.md#beaconblockheader). Notice that objects expand to at most one object of a given expansion type. For example, `BeaconBlockHeader` objects uniquely expand to `BeaconBlock` objects.

## `StableContainer` stability guarantees

The serialization and merkleization of a `StableContainer[N]` remains stable as long as:

- The maximum capacity `N` does not change
- The order of fields does not change
- New fields are always appended to the end
- All fields have immutable SSZ schemas, or recursively adopt `StableContainer[N]`
- `List`/`Bitlist` capacities do not change; shortening is possible via application logic

While the serialization of `Profile[B]` is more compact, note that it is not forward-compatible and that context information that determines the underlying data type has to be indicated out of bands. If forward-compatibility is required, `Profile[B]` SHALL be converted to its base type `B` and subsequently serialized according to `B`.

## Implementations

See https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-specs/issues/2138 for a list of current known implementations.

## JSON mapping

The canonical JSON mapping assigns to each SSZ type a corresponding JSON encoding, enabling an SSZ schema to also define the JSON encoding.

When decoding JSON data, all fields in the SSZ schema must be present with a value. Parsers may ignore additional JSON fields.

| SSZ | JSON | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `uintN` | string | `"0"` |
| `byte` | hex-byte-string | `"0x00"` |
| `boolean` | bool | `false` |
| `Container` | object | `{ "field": ... }` |
| `StableContainer[N]` | object | `{ "field": ... }`; Fields with a `None` value SHALL be omitted when serializing to JSON |
| `Profile[B]` | object | `{ "field": ... }`; Fields with a `None` value SHALL be omitted when serializing to JSON |
| `Vector[type, N]` | array | `[element, ...]` |
| `Vector[byte, N]` | hex-byte-string | `"0x1122"` |
| `Bitvector[N]` | hex-byte-string | `"0x1122"` |
| `List[type, N]` | array | `[element, ...]` |
| `List[byte, N]` | hex-byte-string | `"0x1122"` |
| `Bitlist[N]` | hex-byte-string | `"0x1122"` |
| `Union[type_0, type_1, ...]` | selector-object | `{ "selector": number, "data": type_N }`  |

Integers are encoded as strings to avoid loss of precision in 64-bit values.

Aliases are encoded as their underlying type.

`hex-byte-string` is a `0x`-prefixed hex encoding of byte data, as it would appear in an SSZ stream.

`List` and `Vector` of `byte` (and aliases thereof) are encoded as `hex-byte-string`. `Bitlist` and `Bitvector` similarly map their SSZ-byte encodings to a `hex-byte-string`.

`Union` is encoded as an object with a `selector` and `data` field, where the contents of `data` change according to the selector.
